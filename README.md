A data-driven dashboard for visualizing and analyzing global renewable energy trends, built to empower policymakers, investors, and communities with actionable insights.

Overview

This Tableau-based dashboard was created during the 1M1B Green Internship (Batch 3, 2025) with the help of my team. It visualizes solar, wind, and hydro energy data from 2015â€“2022 for multiple countries. Users can filter and explore detailed, country-specific analyses to inform decisions in sustainability, investment, and policy.
